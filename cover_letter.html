      <p>
        I would be a great addition to any programming team. Due to my <br>
        educational experience, in both learning to program and in entrepreneurship,<br>
        I am prepared to find the resources necessary to learn quickly,<br>
        and work both independently and in groups. I can contribute to <br>
        any object oriented language based project and quickly transition <br>
        when I need to learn new technologies and methodologies. <br>
        <br>
        Two years ago, I started learning to program, in the modern environments<br>
        for contemporary digital platforms. Although my strongest programming <br>
        language is Python, I feel very comfortable using Ruby [including Rails],<br>
         Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and C. I've also been tinkering with Go and <br>
         Objective C, here and there.<br>
        <br>
        My current skill set includes git version control, use of libraries <br>
        and packages to manage and format data from the web, access social media,<br>
        and parse data using regular expressions; databases; interfacing with <br>
        other web applications with APIs using XML &amp; JSON information; <br>
        algorithm fundamentals; operating systems: Linux and Windows; and text<br>
        editors, as well as, internal databases and files. <br>
        <br>
        I am a pragmatic programmer with a work methodology designed for    <br>
        quality and timeliness. Although, this would be my first position in <br>
        programming post college, I have spent the last two years continuously <br>
        working on my programming and computer science skills. <br>
        <br>
        I graduated from Georgia State University in 2012, with a business  <br>
        degree in Marketing, but I started programming in elementary school. <br>
        I would love to talk about what I have been doing for the past two   <br>
        years and what I can bring to your team. The best way to reach me <br>
        is by <a href="mailto:robert.belozi.lee@gmail.com">email</a>. I am currently in Seattle
        and available for interview. <br>
        I look forward to hearing from you soon. <br>
